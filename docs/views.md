# Class-Based Views

Class-Based Views are an alternative way to implement views as Python objects. instead of functions.

They offer advantages of function-based views for some use cases.

For example:

* Organizing code related to HTTP method, such as GET, POST, or PUT in separate methods instead of using conditional branching
* Using multiple inheritance to create reusable view classes (also known as mixins)
